# Student Test Scores Analysis

This project demonstrates the process of importing, cleaning, and analyzing a dataset containing students' test scores using SQL.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about students and their test scores in various subjects. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `student_id`: Unique identifier for each student
- `student_name`: Name of the student
- `test_date`: Date of the test
- `subject`: Subject of the test
- `score`: Score obtained by the student
- `max_score`: Maximum possible score for the test

## Process

The project follows three main steps:

1. Collection: Import the dataset from a CSV file into a new table in the database.
2. Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
3. Manipulation: Calculate insights such as average test scores per subject and per student.
